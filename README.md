# Grandfinder
Grandfinder is an Android app that targets elderly people by providing them the platform to communicate and meet online. 

Final prototype project for `#COSC341 Human Computer Interaction`

Notes:
- Derived from the [friendlychat](https://github.com/firebase/codelab-friendlychat-web) sample project by Google CodeLab
- Integrated with Firebase FirebaseUI that supports multiple signup/login methods
- Built using Java and Kotlin for better interoperability

> **Status of this project:** Currently archived 

## Features demonstrated:
- Authentication with Firebase Authentication SDK associated account information and photo to the profile registered; Sign-in providers includes Google and email/password.
- Realtime peer to peer messaging with Firebase Cloud Messaging SDK using `FriendlyMessageAdapter.kt`.
- Accomondate target user group by integrated design principles that improves further accessibility, including enlarged button and consistent accent colors.
- Profile retriving and switching on the Main Activity works as expected. The App is context awared so that calling the conversation view on the main view jumps to the conversation of that person viewed on the main view.
- Profiles are editable and prompt user when user mistyped a certain field.
- Message notifications are pushed directly to the notification view.
- Consolidate all essential actions onto the AppBar across the UI.
